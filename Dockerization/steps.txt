1. first create an app using flask and the file name is app.py
2. create a Docker file named as dockerfile and it will display the docker logo and the write logic of dockerization inside it

3. after dockerfile code we have to create a docker image and for this we run --> docker build -t filename/foldername (linked with step 7)

4. open the dockerdesk and run the demo hello world image by opening terminal and typing--> docker pull hello-world
5. run the image as --> docker run hello-world
6. after experiencing delete it 

7. after dockerfile, create an image now from vs code terminal as --> docker build -t filename
8. as our image has been created now we can run it from powershell as well by --> docker run filename
9. add tags to an image --> docker tag filename ghulamsidique(username same as dockerhub)/filename
10. push an image to dockerhub as --> docker push username/filename:lastest1 --> here lastest1 is an optional argument 
11. now check the repositroy of dockerhub
12. pull an image --> docker pull username/filename:lastest1
13 run the pulled image --> dockert run -p 5000:5000 username/filename:lastest1
